      <description>One of the rather idiosyncratic things about working in pharma (although I am sure this is true for other highly regulated environments) is systems stay around for a while before they are replaced. Because of these old systems, this week I ran into the need to read in a bunch of tables from an xml document. For those who have never used an xml document, technically there isnâ€™t such as thing as a table, but style sheets can be used to create tables.</description>
